# Data Processing Code - 1310 nm OCT System
The Python scripts provided will allow for the processing of the 1310nm OCT data into .TIF files. \
\
\
How to Use: 
* Open the files using your preferred Python code editor*.

* In the 'TDMSProcessGallery (1310nm).py' code, write the file path to the folder containing your 1310nm data.

* Run the code**. 

>\* I use Spyder through the Anaconda application, you will need to download tifffle through the Anaconda terminal. \
\** You may need to run the code multiple times if an error says there already exists a file. After two attempts, it should have created the two required output folders.
