# Data Processing Code - 1310 nm OCT System
The Python scripts provided will allow for the processing of the 1310nm OCT data into .TIF files. \
\
\
How to Use: 
* Open the files using your preferred Python code editor*.

* In the 'TDMSProcessGallery (1310nm).py' code, write the file path to the folder containing your 1310nm data.

* Run the code**. 

>\* I use Spyder through the Anaconda application. You will need to download tifffle and npTDMS through the Anaconda Prompt terminal, the install lines are provided at the top of the code in 'TDMSProcessGallery (1310nm).py'. \
\** You may need to run the code multiple times if an error says there already exists a file. After two attempts, it should have created the two required output folders.
